## Sailfish OS building instructions
To build Intfuorit for Sailfish OS, you need the [Sailfish OS Application SDK](https://sailfishos.org/wiki/Application_SDK).

At first you have to clone this repository including all submodules (libintfuorit, HBN SFOS Components, ADVobfuscator).

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/Intfuorit.git

Now open the *Intfuorit.pro* project file in the SDK and configure your build targets. For every build target
you have to specify the following additional *qmake arguments* (can be done on the Projects page of the Qt Creator).

    CONFIG+=sfos CONFIG+=no_install_dev_files INSTALL_LIB_DIR=/usr/share/harbour-intfuorit/lib INSTALL_TRANSLATIONS_DIR=/usr/share/harbour-intfuorit/l10n QT_INSTALL_QML_PATH=/usr/share/harbour-intfuorit AES256_KEY=your_aes256_key

To create the translations, run the following script inside the Intfuorit repository base directory:

    ./releasel10n.sh

Now you are ready to build and run Intfuorit on your Sailfish OS device or in the emulator.
