        <source>Some people choose to create accounts using a pattern known as “plus aliasing” in their email addresses. This allows them to express their email address with an additional piece of data in the alias, usually reflecting the site they&apos;ve signed up to such as test+netflix@example.com or test+amazon@example.com. There is presently &lt;a href=&apos;%1&apos;&gt;a UserVoice suggestion&lt;/a&gt; requesting support of this pattern in HIBP. However, as explained in that suggestion, usage of plus aliasing is extremely rare, appearing in approximately only 0.03% of addresses loaded into HIBP.
