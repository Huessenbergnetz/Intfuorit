Often these incidents are comprised of data aggregated from other locations (or may be entirely fabricated), yet still contain actual email addresses of unbeknownst to the account holder. Fabricated breaches are still included in the system because regardless of their legitimacy, they still contain personal information about individuals who want to understand their exposure on the web. Further background on unverified breaches can be found in the blog post titled %1.</source>

        <source>Occasionally, large volumes of personal data are found being utilised for the purposes of sending targeted spam. This often includes many of the same attributes frequently found in data breaches such as names, addresses, phones numbers and dates of birth. The lists are often aggregated from multiple sources, &lt;a href=&apos;%1&apos;&gt;frequently by eliciting personal information from people with the promise of a monetary reward&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst the data may not have been sourced from a breached system, the personal nature of the information and the fact that it&apos;s redistributed in this fashion unbeknownst to the owners warrants inclusion here. &lt;a href=&apos;%2&apos;&gt;Read more about spam lists in HIBP&lt;/a&gt;.</source>
